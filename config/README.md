# The Config Folder

This folder contains your Stacks configuration files. Each file comes with its descriptions, allowing you to easily learn at your own pace.

Note that you may not need all of these config files. For example, if you are not interacting with any database, you can safely delete the `database.ts` config file.

_No worries, it is fully typed._
